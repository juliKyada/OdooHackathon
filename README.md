# 🔁 Skill Swap Platform

Hey there! 👋  
This is a small project I worked on called **Skill Swap Platform** — a simple web app where people can offer their skills and request help from others in return. Think of it as a friendly exchange system where someone can teach you graphic design while you help them learn Python. No money, just knowledge.

## 🌱 Why I Built It

I’ve always liked the idea of community learning — where people help each other grow. We all have something we’re good at and something we want to learn. I built this platform to make that process easier and more structured.

This could be really useful in student communities, small clubs, or even local hobby groups where formal learning isn't always possible or accessible.

## ✨ What You Can Do

### 👤 As a user:
- Sign up and create a simple profile (name, optional photo and location)
- List skills you **can offer** and skills you’re **looking for**
- Set when you’re available (like evenings or weekends)
- Search for people by skill (e.g., “Excel” or “Cooking”)
- Send swap requests, accept or reject them
- Leave feedback or a quick rating after a skill exchange
- Delete pending requests if they’re not accepted

### 🛡️ As an admin:
- Reject inappropriate or spammy skill listings
- Ban users who break platform rules
- Keep track of pending/accepted/cancelled swaps
- Send out announcements (like downtime alerts or new feature updates)
- Export logs and activity reports (user activity, feedback, etc.)
